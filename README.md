Although the first three levels have been completed, including the title and scredits screens, there are still things left to improve.

For example, the third level features a difficulty spike too high for even me, the creator, to succesfully clear with ease. Hazards should be minimized.

I should also add more visual cues such as to where the player should move. The second level is confusing in this since there is no clear indication
at the start of whether it even is a different lvel or the same one.

I should add a reward system, something to incentivise the player to attempt riskier platforming parts. Examples include, timers, coins or strawberries such as 
Mario and Celeste, amon other.
